**Project Name:** Dissertation Project - Cyber Attack Detection and Mitigation using Python.

**Project Description:**
- Looks at system processes and filters down every system process based on a range of filter functions.
- Two layers of filtering - Basic and Advanced.
- Once filtering has been ran, user can check all suspicous processes and terminate them if needed.

**Features:**
- Unique and creative way of detecting/mitigating a range of cyber attacks.
- Clear and concise programming allowing a simple and effective flow of program.
